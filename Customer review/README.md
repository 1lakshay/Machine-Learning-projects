Deployed the most popular NLP technique known as the Bag of words model whose concept is to use the vector of vocabulary to find the sentiment of the inputs

Steps involved in this model are:
1. text preprocessing
2. making sparse matrix/vector
3. training and making prediction from the model

In Text preprocessing phases:
removing any unnecessary character from the text are removed which don't help us to find the sentiment of the input like stopwords like: a,an,the,.... 
, any character which are not the part of english alphabets and converting the full string into lower letters 

Naive Bayes classification model is used to train and make prediction i which Sparsed matrix is feeded to train the model
