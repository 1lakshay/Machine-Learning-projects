Implemented the Hierarchial clustering on Mall customers dataset in which a problem statemtn is to identify and the customers so that 
targeted advertismenet can be run on them so that sales of mall increases.
This problem is the exmaple of the unsupervised learning in which there is no dependent variable or the target variable. 
In this problme hte clustering technique which is known as Hierarchial clusteris implemented. 
There are mainly 2 typesof clustering technque: K-means and Hierarchial clustering.
K-means have little disadvantage to find the optimal nuber of cluster we use Elbow method in which wcss(within cluster sum of squares) and we cant find the optimal 
number of clusters prior to running it which is solved by the Hierarchial clustering whichused the technique of Dendrogram through which we can find the optimal number of cluster 
before running the algorithm.
